# Python implementations of Machine Learning algorithms

This repository contains several `iPython` notebooks, each of which is a standalone project. Each project is a demonstration of implementation of ML algorithms in Python, complete with data analysis and visualization, pre-processing of data (as applicable), splitting the data in 'training' and 'test' datasets for supervised learning algorithms, and the model's performance evaluation.  

These projects are completed as a part of an ongoing online course [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). Wherever data is used without the mention of a source, there the data used is a downloadable resource made available to the students of the aforementioned course.  

More projects (on implementation of further ML algorithms) will be added as I make progress in the online course. In some cases, though it is straightforward that the performance of the model could be improved via an iterative process, the aim of these projects is simply to gain a first hands-on experience in implementing the various algorithms in Python.
